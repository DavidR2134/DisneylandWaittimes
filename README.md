# Disneyland Wait Times

This code pulls from <a>https://queue-times.com/</a> for Disneyland Park and Disney's California Adventure Park.
Information is parsed from a JSON file and uploaded to a couple SQL tables on my local system. The Ride table provides current wait times as of the last update while the transaction table allows me to track history and present averages.
